# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating images. 

<h1>How it works<br></h1>



• Generator: The Generator class defines the generator network, which takes random noise as input and generates synthetic images. It consists of two fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions and a final layer with a Tanh activation function to produce images.

• Discriminator: The Discriminator class defines the discriminator network, which aims to distinguish between real and fake images. It also consists of two fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions, followed by a final sigmoid layer for binary classification.
